## What Is SpicyChat AI?

SpicyChat AI is an uncensored chatbot platform that lets you design fully-custom AI partners, give them rich back-stories, and chat without the usual content filters. Powered by large models like **Chronos-Hermes 13B** and **Pygmalion 7B**, it remembers context (up to **8 K tokens** on premium), speaks 40+ languages, and supports text-to-speech plus image replies. Think Character AI, minus the parental controls, plus way deeper character sliders.

## Pros & Cons

| ✅ Pros                                                           | ❌ Cons                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimal guardrails** – SFW or NSFW role-play permitted         | Mobile & web apps crash during peak hours    |
| **4 K–8 K context window** (paid) → better memory                | Image generation often misgenders / glitches |
| **Deep character builder** – name, avatar, personality, scenario | Repetitive replies after very long chats     |
| **Multiple LLMs** – swap for storytelling vs Q\&A                | Long-term memory still session-bound         |
| **Massive community** – 950 k+ shared characters                 | Trust score only “medium”; some users wary   |
| **Freemium** – solid free tier, no credit card to start          | Premium price jumps if you need 8 K context  |

## My Real-World Use Cases

* **Cyberpunk novella co-author:** drafted a 12-chapter romance with an android named *Lira*; SpicyChat kept timeline + character arcs straight.
* **Spanish practice buddy:** switched model + language to stay in Spanish for 30-minute daily sessions.
* **After-hours escapism:** created *Raven*, a vampire bartender, for NSFW role-play few platforms allow.

| -------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Guardrails     | 🏆 Minimal              | Strict         | Semi-open      | Strict            |
| Context window | 8 K (paid)              | \~4 K          | 4 K            | \~2 K             |
| Custom avatars | Yes, upload or generate | Yes            | Yes            | Yes               |
| Voice replies  | Yes (TTS)               | No             | Yes            | Yes               |
| Image replies  | Yes                     | No             | No             | Limited           |
| Price          | Freemium / \$14.99 mo+  | Free           | \$9.99 mo+     | \$19.99 mo        |
| Best for       | Unfiltered RP & NSFW    | PG story chats | Romantic AI GF | Emotional support |

**Verdict:** If you need maximum freedom or adult role-play, SpicyChat sits alone at the top; for strictly PG chats, Character AI or Replika feel safer.

**How to Run SpicyChat’s Model on Replicate**

Follow these steps to package, publish, and run your SpicyChat AI model using Replicate.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Docker installed and running
* Replicate account & API token
* Your SpicyChat code in a local Git repo

---

## 2. Install Cog

Cog turns your Python code into a Docker-powered model.

```bash
pip install cog
```

---

## 3. Add a `cog.yaml`

Place this at your repo root to define build and predict steps:

```yaml
build:
  command: pip install -r requirements.txt

predict:
  image: python:3.10
  command: python - << 'EOF'
import sys, json
import spicychat

# Read inputs and generate completion
inputs = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(spicychat.generate(inputs["prompt"]))
EOF
```

---

## 4. Build Your Model Container

```bash
cd path/to/your/repo
cog build
```

---

## 5. Publish to Replicate

1. **Login**

   ```bash
   replicate login
   ```
2. **Push**

   ```bash
   replicate push --model spicychat/ai-chat
   ```

   You’ll get a model reference like `spicychat/ai-chat:latest`.

---

## 6. Invoke Your Model

### a) CLI

```bash
replicate run spicychat/ai-chat:latest \
  --input prompt="Hello, how are you?"
```

### b) Python

```python
import os, replicate

os.environ["REPLICATE_API_TOKEN"] = "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
model = replicate.models.get("spicychat/ai-chat")
print(model.predict(prompt="Hello, how are you?"))
```

### c) Node.js

```js
import Replicate from "replicate";
const replicate = new Replicate({ auth: process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN });

const output = await replicate.run(
  "spicychat/ai-chat:latest",
  { input: { prompt: "Hello, how are you?" } }
);
console.log(output);
```
